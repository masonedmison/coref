# Result codes

[Base Naming Conventions]
results files are in the form of:
<model_size>_<pipline/module>_<codes>.txt
    e.g. md_scispacy_alg_plfp_glfpma

-- multiple codes are seperated by '_'

[Codes]
[Duplicate Literal Forms]
Predicted duplicate literal forms pruned: plfp
Gold duplicate literal forms pruned (max span only): glfpma
Gold duplicate literal forms pruned (max&min span): glfpmami

[Spans]
allow pred cluster overlap of gold cluster: pco

[Vectors]
bwv = 50dim BioWordVec word vectors (trained on pubmed and mesh data)

[Params]
g=0<n<1 = greedyness parameter value -- if not specified assume value of 0.5
